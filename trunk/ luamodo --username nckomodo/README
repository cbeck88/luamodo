NOTES
=====
There's two examples of extensions in the /Extensions/, Stats and Control
There's a single example of a bot in /Bots/, TestBot
Run main.lua to launch the program, all bots and extensions will be loaded automatically, so no need to use any dofiles
Make sure to poke around in the extensions and bots examples to find anything you need to change
